The goal of `shinyshval` is to provide a user-friendly shiny-application  as interface to [SHVAL tool](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en-623) developed by EFSA.
It computes shortcut values (SV) as an estimate for the expected oral uptake of plant protection products residues by bees. 


## Demo

You can fire-up a demo application on binder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/basf/shinyshval/binder?urlpath=shiny)

## Installation

You can install the app-package from github via

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("basf/shinyshval")
```

## Starting the app locally

Simply run

```{r run, eval=FALSE}
shinyshval::run_app()
```

## Using the backend

We can compute shval values for default parameters of Honey Bee foragers.

First we retrieve the defaults
```{r defaults}
# retrieve defaults
defaults <- shinyshval::default_estimates(species = "Honey Bee", 
                                          stadium = "larvae")
```

Than we estimate the parameters for the default inputs

```{r param}
param <- shinyshval::get_param(raw = NULL, est = defaults)
```

And finally we can simulate the SHVAL values

```{r sim}
shvals <- shinyshval::sim(param)
```

These can than be summarized in different ways 

```{r hist}
hist(shvals)
```

```{r summary}
# Mean
mean(shvals)
# 95% CI
quantile(shvals, c(0.025, 0.975))
```


## Quality assurance


In order to ensure consistent results between the `shinyshval` and original EFSA SHVAL tool,
the package is under version control and an extensive set of tests have been implemented using `testthat`. 

In short, a total number of 192 continuously integrated tests are run on each code change.
These tests that cover 100% of back-end functionality. 

* 156 for the internal functioning of function for the app
* 36 tests of 9 scenarios specifically aimed at comparison of results with the official EFSA script.

Because of the non-deterministic nature of the computations, comparisons are made with a precision of $1x10^{-1}$ to $1x10^{-2}$.
Reference results form the original script can be found in the `inst/test_reference`for each scenario.
