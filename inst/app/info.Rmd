SHVAL: Estimation of the residue intake rate for certain bee species under given conditions
====================

## Introduction


One aim of the exposure assessment is to provide input into the assessment of the daily residue intake rate of bees. This residue intake rate (*RI*) is calculated as

$$RI =  \frac{PEC_{pollen} C_{pollen} + PEC_{nectar} C_{nectar}}{1000}$$

where PEC are the *predicted environmental concentrations* (mg/kg) in pollen and nectar and 
$C$ are the *consumption rates* (mg/day) of a bee species for pollen and nectar.

The consumption rate of nectar (*$C_{nectar}$*) is assessed as the quotient of the intake rate of sugar
(*$d_{sugar}$* (mg/day)) and the sugar content of nectar (*$m_{sugar}$* (kg/kg)).

$$RI =  \frac{PEC_{pollen} C_{pollen} + PEC_{nectar} \frac{d_{sugar}}{m_{sugar}}}{1000}$$

PECs can be also derived from actual measurements. 
Concentrations in nectar and pollen are based on the residue unit dose (*RUD*),
which is defined as the residue in mg/kg at a dose of 1 kg/ha.

Shortcut Values (SV) are used in lower tier risk assessment and combine these:

$$SV =  \frac{RUD_{pollen} C_{pollen} + RUD_{nectar} \frac{d_{sugar}}{m_{sugar}}}{1000}$$

So $SV$ estimates the daily residue intake rate of a bee (Î¼g/day) for a deposition of 1 kg/ha.
Different bee species have different values of *$C_{pollen}$*, *$d_{sugar}$* and *$m_{sugar}$*.

If there is information for decline of $RUDs$ available, simulations can be carried out to assess a 
time-weighted average (TWA) SV:

$$ SV_{TWA} = \frac{1}{1000} \left( \frac{RUD_{pollen} C_{pollen}}{k_{pollen} t} (1-exp(-k_{pollen} t)) 
+ \frac{RUD_{nectar} \frac{d_{sugar}}{m_{sugar}}}{k_{nectar} t}(1-exp(-k_{nectar} t)\right)$$

where *$k$* is the decay rate of pollen and nectar and *$t$* is the time-window to considered.

## Computations

SV are calculated using Monte-Carlo simulations taking uncertainty into account.
Distributions are fitted for each input parameter: normal for *$RUD_{pollen}$*, *$RUD_{pollen}$*, *$C_{pollen}$*, *$d_{sugar}$* and beta for *$m_{sugar}$*) which are used in simulations.

One simulation-run consists of 1000 simulated hives, from which the $90^{th}$ percentile of SV is determined.

The median of 1000 simulated  $90^{th}$ percentile SV is used for exposure assessment.


## Usage

The tool needs inputs for *$RUD_{pollen}$*, *$RUD_{pollen}$*, *$C_{pollen}$*, *$d_{sugar}$* and *$m_{sugar}$*.

* *$RUD_{pollen}$* and *$RUD_{pollen}$* should be **natural-log transformed** values
* *$C_{pollen}$*, *$d_{sugar}$* and *$m_{sugar}$* should **untransformed** values

### Inputs

There are two possibilities to enter parameters:

1. You can copy & paste *measurements* of each parameter (*Measurements* tab), from which the distribution will fitted.
2. You can specify estimates (*Estimates* tab). You can specify the mean + sd, or a range or a best-guess for parameters.

The bar on the left *Needed inputs* shows you if there something missing for computation.

### Default parameters.

Default parameters for *$C_{pollen}$*, *$d_{sugar}$* and *$m_{sugar}$* for different bee species and types have been defined (according to EFSA Guideline).

You can select these by clicking on the buttons. These will change the values in the *Estimates* tab,
you can also change these afterwards (changes will be gone after selecting a different species.)

### Outputs

Simulation results of the $90^{th}$ percentile SV including 95% Confidence Intervals are shown on the left.


## Quality Assurance

Code-base is under version control and a extensive set of tests have been implemented in order to assure that this tool gives the same results as the official EFSA tool.


In short, a total number of 192 continuously integrated tests are run on each code change.
These tests that cover 100% of back-end functionality. 

* 156 for the internal functioning of function for the app
* 36 tests of 9 scenarios specifically aimed at comparison of results with the official EFSA script
  
Comparisons are made with a precision of 1x10^-1 to 1x10^-2.
